# leaf-classification

Different Machine learning algorithms are perfromed on kaggle leaf dataset for leaf classification purpose. The dataset consists of different species like:
* Cornus_Controversa
* Quercus_Pubescens
* Celtis_Koraiensis
* Acer_Platanoids
* Alnus_Maximowiczii
* etc.,

# Machine learning algorithms

* Logistic regression
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest Classifier
* Gradient Boost
* Support Vector Machine
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Neural Networks

# Summary 
The random forest classifier provides nearly 97% of accurate results however, the single neural network also provide an accuracy rate of 98% in the classification process.
